  "bio": "I am a music artist, pianist, and producer based in the Netherlands with a wide range of experiences across diverse genres—classical, jazz, metal, pop, and electronic. Each opportunity I’ve had has shaped me, giving me new skills and perspectives to grow as a creator. By nature, I am curious and brave, always eager to explore new sounds, ideas, and collaborations. I love working with others and hearing their visions—it inspires me to step into different worlds and connect with their creativity. Music has always been close to my heart; it runs in my family, where it was part of every celebration and good time. That deep connection keeps fueling my passion today. I always listen, follow, and watch what’s new in music, and I love to see where the music world is going. With every project, I take a different approach. I keep my eyes, ears, and senses open to understand what is needed, and I adapt quickly and easily to the circumstances. This openness and flexibility are among my strongest skills as an artist and collaborator.",
